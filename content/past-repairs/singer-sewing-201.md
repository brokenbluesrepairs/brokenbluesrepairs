What a find this was!

**Symptoms**:
- My client found this in an alley downtown.
- The speed control was not working well.
- The bobin winder barely turned.
- The thread spindle was missing.
- The running of the machine was sporadic and rough.

**Diagnosis**:
- The machine was generally dirty.
- I discovered the set screws underneath the bobin holder was not fully screwed in and then moving parts were hitting those screws every rotation.
- The bobin winder needed oil.

**Solution**:
- I cleaned the machine.
- I tightened the set screws underneath the bobin holder to prevent the machine from hitting them.
- I oiled all the moving parts.

**Testing**:
- We tested sewing a stitch on some fabric and it worked well.
