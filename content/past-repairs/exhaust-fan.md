This fan didn't even turn it was so filthy.


**Symptoms**:
- The fan would creak a bit and not really turn at all.

**Diagnosis**:
- I pulled the cover off and discovered years of collected dust.
- The whole area was filthy, which also meant that the motor was dirty and needed to be cleaned and oiled.

**Solution**:
- I took everything down and removed the motor from the C-frame.
- I cleaned out all the dust, and oiled the moving parts with machine oil.
- I reinstalled everything. No replacements necessary.

**Testing**:
- I turned the fan on and it ramped up in complete silence :)
