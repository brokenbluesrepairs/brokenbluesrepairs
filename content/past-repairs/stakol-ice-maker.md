Persistence was key on this one.

**Symptoms**:
- Machine turned on, but didn't operate.

**Diagnosis**:
- I had to take this one almost completely apart before finding one red wire coming from the control board that had severed.

**Solution**:
- I soldered the red wire together, put on heat shrink, and reassembled it.

**Testing**:
- We put some water in and ran the machine. All was working as expected.
