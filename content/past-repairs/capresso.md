This [Capresso 303](https://www.capresso.com/espresso-machines/4-cup-espresso-cappuccino-machine.html) required creativity. Someone brought this into the Tucson Repair Cafe.


**Symptoms**:

- It wasn't making coffee, and the coffee/steam selector knob was broken.

**Diagnosis**:
- It took some work to get this baby open, but seventeen screws later, I found that the plastic selector knob had snapped at its base, preventing correct operation.

**Solution**:
- A replacement knob couldn't be ordered, but a different solution had to be devised.
- I went to Ace Hardware and created a knob using a bolt, some washers and nuts, and a zinc corner brace.
- The picture shows some heat shrink used to test the knob, but the final solution used a rubber handle cover, which created a very user-friendly, good-looking knob.

**Testing**:
- I tested making an espresso and a cappucino, in order to test the frother. All worked great!
