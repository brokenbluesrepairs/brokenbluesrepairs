My host mom in France got this bike used and the spedometer never worked.

**Symptoms**:
- When the pedals were rotating, the speed and distance readings stayed at 0.0. Everything else worked, including the heart rate sensor.

**Diagnosis**:
- I first checked the bike computer and everything looked ok.
- After various unscrewing to get access to the cables, I found multiple spots where the wires were just twisted together and taped, so I hope it was just faulty connections.

**Solution**:
- I soldered all the wire connections and put on heat shrink, and the spedometer started working!

**Testing**:
- I rode on the bike for a bit and ensured all the data was coming in.
