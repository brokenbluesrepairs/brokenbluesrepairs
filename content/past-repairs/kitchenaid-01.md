All it takes is some grime on the contacts.

**Symptoms**:
- The mixer was either not turning on at all, or turning on for a split second every time the speed was changed.

**Diagnosis**:
- After opening the back cover, to expose the speed control plate, I found the on/off contact switch.
- This switch had some grime on it, most likely preventing proper contact. The reason it might turn on for a split second is the force applied to the contact at the moment it makes contact, whereas once the contact is made, the stationary force isn't enough to overcome the dirt.
- The speed control plate was also potentially not calibrated.

**Solution (Dirty Contact)**:
- I cleaned off the switch contact with some isopropyl alcohol and everything started working again.

**Solution (Speed Control)**:
- I looked up the specs for the mixer and adjusted the speed control plate screws so that the measured distance was 3/4".

**Testing**:
- I tested the mixed briefly without anything in a bowl to mix, and it worked fine.
- My client tested the mixer by making a batch of cookies and said everything worked perfectly.
