Found this gem at the [Family Bargain Thrift Shop](https://kovrigcarina.wixsite.com/familybargain) on Grant & 7th.

**Symptoms**:
- The foot control pedal would only depress with a lot of force, preventing any real speed control.
- The bobin holder kept coming out and jamming.
- The thread would jam in the bobin holder.

**Diagnosis**:
- After taking apart the foot control pedal, I determined that it was mostly likely lack of lubrication causing friction in the joint.
- The bobin case bump was getting under the spring, which shouldn't happen.

**Solution (Foot Control)**:
- I lubricated the moving parts of the foot control pedal.
- I screwed the spring down so that the bobin case bump couldn't pass underneath the spring.

**Testing**:
- I tested sewing the first several stitch types using varying speeds, and everything worked great.
