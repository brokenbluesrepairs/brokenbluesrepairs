I found this [GE Profile Spacemaker II Sensor](https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-Profile-Spacemaker-II-Microwave-Oven-JEM31SF) microwave near a dumpster and it needed some TLC.


**Diagnosis**:
- Coupler between the motor and turntable was broken. Power cord was cut.

**Solution (Motor Coupler)**:
- I unscrewed the bottom panel to reveal the motor. After unscrewing the motor and pulling it out, I was able to remove the broken motor coupler.
- After taking measurements of the old coupler and the glass turntable, I used the computer-aided design software OnShape to design a new one. I 3D printed it at [Xerocraft Makerspace](https://xerocraft.org/pages/3dprint) in Downtown Tucson. I made the new one out of PLA (Polylatcic acid).

**Solution (Power Cord)**:
- I unscrewed and removed the top panel to reveal the inards of the microwave. One screw was tamper resistant with a center pin, requiring a special screwdriver bit.
- The cord was connected with female disconnect terminals, which I removed.
- I purchased a new cord from [Elliot Electronic Surplus](https://elliottelectronicsurplus.com/) on 23rd & Tyndall and crimped new terminals on, attached them, and tested the microwave. All was dandy :)

**Testing**:
I tested heating food with the microwave.
