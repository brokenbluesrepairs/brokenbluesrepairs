This 5-disc CD changer required some finesse.


**Symptoms**:
- When a disc was inserted, the disc would just spin endlessly, and never play anything.

**Diagnosis**:
- I had to open the device completely, and remove the CD tray, which proved tricky.
- After some testing I discovered that both the CD tray and CD spin pulley belts were over stretched and need to be replaced.

**Solution**:
- The belts could be ordered, but in the meantime I was able to double-over each belt, reinstall them, and everything works perfectly again.

**Testing**:
- I tested changing discs and playing each one. Everything spun as desired.
