This was a case of grimy battery contacts.

**Symptoms**:
- This digital kitchen scale just wouldn't turn on.

**Diagnosis**:
- I instructed the owner to clean the battery contacts, even though they looked pretty clean.
- She cleaned the contacts with isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab.
- After getting the contacts super clean, the scale worked fine.

**Testing**:
- We tested weighing different objects and turning the scale on and off several times.
