No power? . . . A dirty potentiometer?

**Symptoms**:
- The radio wasn't turning on.

**Diagnosis**:
- The client and I both measured for continuity at the outlet of the volume knob and got no reading.

**Solution**:
- I sprayed some contact cleaner in the volume potentiometer and rotated it a bunch through it's range.
- This got the radio turning on, but the volume knob was a bit scratchy.
- I sprayed more contact cleaner, making sure to get inside on the whole wiper, and the scratching went away!

**Testing**:
- We tested tuning the radio across its range and the signal was clear.
