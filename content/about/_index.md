heading: "I'm Pete, a Tucsonan passionate about bringing your broken stuff back to life."
description: "I specialize in repairing those broken items that others won't even attempt, like small appliances, gadets, you name it. My priority is helping you, at a price you deem worthy. If you want to practice transparent generosity, donate what you feel my service was worth. If you want an up front price, I'll make sure it's less than the cost of a replacement. Don't think I'll repair your item? Just ask. My background is in electro-mechanical repair, mechanical engineering, robotics software and controls, avionics, and web development."
